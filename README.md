# AgileSoftwareDevelopment

This repository contains code that was developed as part of the Agile Software Development module of the H.Dip in SOftware Development at GMIT.

## Project

For the project I was required to develop a JUnit automated test suite that is capable of testing the a Java application. I was provided with code that I was required to refactor so that it can be tested using JUnit5. Tes test needed to contain a test suite and the code should contain the following annotations @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach,@Test, @ParameterizedTest, @Timeout, @AfterAll and @AfterEach. 

The program was desugbed to calculate car insurance premium based on age and the suite needed to test every method of the refactored code.
